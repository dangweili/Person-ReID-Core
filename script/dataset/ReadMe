for image-based person re-identification, as follows:
single-shot, only using identity
mutiple-shot, only using identity
single-query, fixed query + test identity, default
mutiple-query, fixed expansion query + test identity

# for single-shot, as follow:
1: generate query with generate gallery using test identities

# for mutiple-shot, as follow:
1: generate query expansion

# for single-query, as follows:
1: fixed query with fixed gallery, for market1501 dataset
2: generate query with generate gallery, for cuhk03 dataset

# for mutiple-query, as follows:
1: fixed query expansion with fixed gallery
2: generate query expansion with generated gallery

for sequence-based person re-identification, as follows:
step 1: generate the sequence-based representation for each sequence 
step 2: using the same principle as image-based person re-identification
